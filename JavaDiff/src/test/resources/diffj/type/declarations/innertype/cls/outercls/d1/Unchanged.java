     * Well nine and twenty in a company
     * Of sundry folk, by aventure y-fall
     * In fellowship*, and pilgrims were they all,
     * That toward Canterbury woulde ride.
     * The chamber, and the stables were wide,
     * And well we weren eased at the best.
     * And shortly, when the sunne was to rest,
     * So had I spoken with them every one,
     * That I was of their fellowship anon,
     * And made forword* early for to rise,
     * To take our way there as I you devise.
