      At Leyes was he, and at Satalie,
      When they were won; and in the Greate Sea
      At many a noble army had he be.

      And foughten for our faith at Tramissene.
      In listes thries, and aye slain his foe.

      Some time with the lord of Palatie,
      Against another heathen in Turkie:
      And evermore he had a sovereign price.
