/* But for to speaken of her conscience, */
/* She was so charitable and so pitous, */
/* She woulde weep if that she saw a mouse */
/* Caught in a trap, if it were dead or bled. */
/* Of smalle houndes had she, that she fed */
/* With roasted flesh, */ class /* and milk, and wastel bread. */
/* But sore she wept if one of them were dead, */
/* Or if men smote it with a yarde smart: */
/* And all was conscience and tender heart. */
/* Full seemly her */ Unchanged /* wimple y-pinched was; */
/* Her nose tretis; her eyen gray as glass; */
/* Her mouth full small, and thereto soft and red*/ { /*; */
/* But sickerly she had a fair */ Unchanged /* forehead. */ (
/* It was almost a spanne broad I trow; */
/* For hardily she was not undergrow. */
/* Full fetis was her cloak, as I was ware. */
/* Of small coral about her arm she bare */ )
/* A pair of beades,*/ { /* gauded all with green; */
/* And thereon hung a brooch of gold */ char /* full sheen, */
/* On which */ c /* was first y-written*/=/* a crown'd A*/'A'/*, */
